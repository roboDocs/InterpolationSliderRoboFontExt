# Interpolation Slider RoboFont Extension

by Andy Clymer, [www.andyclymer.com](http://www.andyclymer.com)

Created for the Type@Cooper “Drawing for Interpolation” workshop at the Typographics conference in New York, June 2018

The extension is designed to give a simple interface to preview how the points move during an interpolation of two masters. After selecting two UFO masters, an interpolated glyph will be drawn in te current glyph window.
